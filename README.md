# Project: Survival Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with detailed survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimators. The project involves:

- Analyzing survival data using statistical methods.
- Generating and visualizing survival curves and hazard functions.

## Screenshots

For users who prefer to view the results as images rather than interacting with the Jupyter notebook, screenshots of key outputs are available in the `Damianbrian patch-1` branch. These screenshots provide a visual representation of the results and plots from the notebook.

To access the screenshots:
- Switch to the `Damianbrian patch-1` branch in this repository.
- The branch contains images of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard plots, and other visualizations.

## How to Access the Jupyter Notebook

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook located in the main branch to explore the analysis interactively.
